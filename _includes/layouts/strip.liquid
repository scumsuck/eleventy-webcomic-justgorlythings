eleventyComputed:
  # eleventyComputed is a special metadata type in 11ty, as it allows for using
  # templating functions within front matter data. In our use case, we have it
  # set to generate a title based on the page's filename if we didn't give it
  # one within the front matter data.
  # (https://www.11ty.dev/docs/data-computed/)
  title: "{% if title %}{{ title }}{% else %}Page {{ page.fileSlug }}{% endif %}"

Beyond breaking pages into multiple components that can be included at will,
Liquid files can apply data from 11ty onto pages. For a full breakdown on using
tags and variables in Liquid, see https://liquidjs.com.

As a quick rundown for how this file works, we use the `unless` tag to display
content depending on if we have data, and the `render` tag includes another
Liquid file within the template.
{% endcomment %}<div class="comic">
  {% render 'comic.liquid', collection: collections.comic, page: page, images: images, alt: alt %}
</div>
{%# If we have author notes, include them %}
<div class="authorNotes paperDiv">
  {% unless content == "" %}
      <h1>{{ title }}</h1>
      <p class="authorNotes-date">posted on {{page.date | date: "%b %d, %Y"}}</p>
      {{ content }}
  {% endunless %}
</div>

<div class="paperDiv commentForm">
  <div id="c_widget"></div>
  <script src="/js/comment-widget.js"></script>
</div>
