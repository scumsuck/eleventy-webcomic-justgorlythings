alt: Two panel comic.  First panel depicts Liv at her laptop, drooling with her headphones on.  Basile is scowling at her, hunched over with his cane and glasses.  He states, 'BAH!  Kids and their computers -- you'll go BLIND!'.  Second panel depicts Liv and Basile on the couch together watching TV and drooling.  Basile is completely zonked out watching the TV screen, covered up with a warm blanket.  Liv has fallen asleep and is snoring.
