title: Nancy's Boys - Hair Today...
images: ['/img/comics/pg48.png']
alt: A four panel comic.  First panel is John Redcorn driving Nancy Gribble in his jeep.  Dale Gribble swoops into the frame with a question mark and exclamation mark.  Second panel, Dale is very close to John's hair and sniffing it aggressively.  John is sweating.  Dale is grimacing.  Third panel, Dale says 'HAHA! Hey John Redcorn!  Your hair smells like a WOMAN'S!  I bet you use conditioner like NANCY!!!'.  John pushes away Dale's dialogue balloon with his driving hand.  Nancy looks uncomfortable and says 'seeya sug'.  It's implied that John Redcorn shares conditioner with Nancy (Dale's wife) because they're having an affair.  It's also implied that Dale doesn't know to use conditioner on his own hair.  Panel 4, some time later, Nancy is crying and pulling her hair out.  Her mascara is running.  She cries 'Would you still think I'm pretty when I'm BALD?!'  John looks at her with a straight face and says 'Yes.'  In John's thought bubble is a hatless Dale with his baldness uncovered, shirtless with his nipples out, smiling with an arm behind his head sexily.

Watched the new season 14 of King of The Hill.  Became yaoi-brained for a bisexual threesome of Nancy/John/Dale.  I feel like all their baby daddy drama could be solved if Nancy became a fujoshi and let John and Dale kiss too.

[Whim had a theory](https://wiki.scumsuck.com/blog:2025:0825blaugust_22_ode_to_a_fella_john_redcorn_s_playlist_edition#discussion__section) that John was hitting on Nancy in the episode where she's balding cuz Dale is bald.  And bald is his pheromone.  It's a good theory!  It explains why John's back to macking on Nancy even though he said in Season 4 he'd stop massaging her cuz Dale's his good friend.
