alt: Three panel comic.  First panel depicts two girls in a bed.  A weiner dog lays between them.  Voices from outside ask, 'What do they talk about all night?' 'Boys,probably'.  Second panel focuses on the two girls touching hands, a word bubble from both of them depicts two men, a Spy and a Scout, about to embrace.  The third panel zooms in closer to their mutually depraved faces.  Their thought bubble now depicts the beginning of the two men having intercourse.

Liv and Sophie are gal pals.  They share a bed.  And they spend all night talking about cute stories they make up for each other.
