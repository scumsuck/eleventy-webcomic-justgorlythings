**JUST GORLY Thingz"** is a lesbian fujoshi web comic, chronicling **<a href="https://scumsuck.com/characters/ollienbasile/liv/">Liv's</a>** mundane slice of married life.  Living as a fujoshi, yumejoshi, and himejoshi... she does it all!</p>

This comic is written and drawn by <a href="https://scumsuck.com/about/">SCUMSUCK</a>. 
            
 Our protaganist, <strong>Liv</strong> is a BL (yaoi) author.  Meaning she writes gay comics depicting man-on-man relationships. <p> Sometimes Liv is married to another gorl Scout, <strong>Sophie</strong>, the character of which belongs to my wife Shane.  On other occassions, Liv is also married to <strong><a href="https://scumsuck.com/characters/ollienbasile/basile/">an old spy, Basile.</a></strong>          
               
There is no schedule for this comic.  I draw these characters whenever I have an idea.

In Japan it's a jokey stereotype that fujoshi tend to be lesbians (since they're unattractive to men, they MUST find solace in each other!).  I think it's pretty cool when girls who like girls write about dudes who like dudes.  And I love fujo4fujo relationships.  So I made this comic.
