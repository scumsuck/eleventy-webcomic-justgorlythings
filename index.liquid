This is a Liquid file, which extends HTML with templating functions! They're
used similarly to the `comic_header.js` and `comic_footer.js` scripts in
Rarebit, except that they can also take in data from 11ty's Data Cascade
(https://www.11ty.dev/docs/data/). They're then compiled into regular HTML
files by 11ty during the build process. For more on Liquid, see `strip.liquid`.

Part of the data cascade includes collections, which are groups of pages
specified by tags (https://www.11ty.dev/docs/collections/). You can specify
individual collections to use within templates.
