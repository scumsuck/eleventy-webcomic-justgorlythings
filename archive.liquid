<!--
Writing sections of the archive involves including the `chapter.liquid` 
component onto the page. Including it requires two variables...
thumbnails: A boolean indicating whether you want thumbnails
collection: The comic (chapter) collection you want to display; if you gave a
page a tag in its front matter, that tag becomes a collection you can point to

For more information on collections, see https://www.11ty.dev/docs/collections/
--><h2>Chronological Order</h2>

{% comment %} 
by default this is set to display by chapter. Chapter view only has the first chapter page, no thumbnails per page.
If you would rather a list of just pages, remove chapters: chapters, below, and then set thumbnails to true or false depending on if you'd like each page to have a thumbnail
{% endcomment %}
{% render 'chapter.liquid', thumbnails: true, collection: collections  %}
